This repository contains a set of prototypes to test and explore the validity of some of our ideas.

If you are working at kaliber en want to find out which credentials to provide, please look in the
database, they are there.

Some prototypes include `kaliberjs-prototypes-firebase-credentials.json` which is ignored by the
`.gitignore` file. This file is obtained by creating a key for a service account in Firebase.
The steps can be found in the [server setup documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/server/setup).
